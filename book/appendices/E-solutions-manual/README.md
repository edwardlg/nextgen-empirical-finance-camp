# Appendix E — Solutions Manual

This appendix works every problem set in the camp, all twelve weeks of it. A solution here is not an answer key: it is the full path from the problem to the number. Where a result needs proving, you get the derivation — intuition first, then a worked numerical case, then the algebra, in the order CONVENTIONS asks for. Where a result needs computing, you get the runnable code that produces it. And every solution closes the loop with interpretation: what the number means for the question that motivated the problem, and where the method would break if you pushed it.

Weeks 1–6 are **numeric drills**. The questions have right answers, and the solutions reach them by hand and in code so you can check both your arithmetic and your reasoning. Weeks 7–12 are different: those problem sets scaffold your own research project across its full life — question, data pull, pre-analysis plan, robustness battery, deck (Weeks 7–8); conference presentation and feedback intake (Week 9); paper refinement with multiple-testing, heterogeneity, mechanism, and external-validity discipline (Week 10); manuscript writing (Week 11); and submission, archiving, and the long arc to a published paper (Week 12). They have no single right answer. For those, the manual gives **A-grade model deliverables** — one fully worked exemplar per assignment, built on the chapter's running student-cast example, so you can see the shape and discipline of "done well" before you build your own. The numbers in those exemplars are illustrative teaching figures, never real licensed-data output, and they are labeled as such inside each file.

**How to use this.** Try the problem first. Sit with it, get stuck, write down a wrong answer — then read the solution. A worked solution you read before attempting the problem teaches you almost nothing; the same solution read after a genuine attempt is where the learning happens. If your number disagrees with ours, find out why before you move on: the disagreement is usually the most instructive thing on the page.

**Honesty norm.** These solutions exist so you can learn from them, not copy from them. Submitting a solution from this manual as your own work is the one thing that defeats the entire point of the camp — the camp exists to build *your* judgment, and the only person you cheat is yourself. Cite the manual if you lean on it. When you are unsure whether something crosses the line, ask your mentor.

All solutions follow the notation in [`CONVENTIONS.md`](../../../CONVENTIONS.md) §3 — $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$, $\operatorname{Var}(\cdot)$, $\operatorname{Cov}(\cdot,\cdot)$; bold for vectors and matrices; hats for estimates; standard errors always labeled by flavor (classical, HC1/2/3, HAC, clustered). Every empirical spec names its outcome, key regressor, controls, fixed effects, clustering, sample, and identifying assumption, per §4. All arithmetic in this manual was verified numerically.
